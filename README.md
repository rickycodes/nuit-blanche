Node.js + Three.js + Twitter = Realtime visualization created for Nuit Blanche Ottawa, ON.

Created in collaboration with [@jackpine](https://twitter.com/JackpineCo) and [@taulantsulko](https://twitter.com/TaulantSulko)

## Instalation

Clone away, jump into the project and then:

```
npm install

You'll have to rename config.js.sample → config.js modify it AND init.js (depending) to get it working for your enviroment ;)

Enjoy
